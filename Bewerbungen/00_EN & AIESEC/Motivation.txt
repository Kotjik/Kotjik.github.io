Dear Sir or Madam,

there are several reasons why I am the best candidate for this opportunity. I do my best to excel, whether in an academic or professional setting. I work very well as a team with both fellow students and work colleagues and support my teammates when they need help.

I was originally born in Russia and prove multicultural roots. I would like to expand this horizon even further by gaining work experience in a country I have not been to yet. I am confident with the English language, which will help me communicating in a large international company.

I learn to deal with foreign concepts or tools very quickly and I am always ready to try something new, which is demonstrated by the course of my professional experience. At university I also learned to think analytically and critically.

I hope I could convince you of me and I am looking forward to a conversation with you!

With kind regards,
Konstantin Kulik
